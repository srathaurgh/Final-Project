  <h1>Shreya Rathaur's AP Computer Science Portfolio</h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Shreya Rathaur and I am currently in AP Computer Science Principles. Before this class, I had absolutely no background knowledge on coding- I didn't even know the names of the different languages. Computer Science and coding was not something I saw myself doing in the future, but I took the class to gain an experience of coding that I otherwise wouldn't have had. This class taught me a lot thanks to Mr. Alvarado and it not only made computer science and coding more accessible and understandable, it made it more enjoyable. I feel like the satisfaction you get when you resolve a bug in your code and it starts working as intended is unmatched!</p>
